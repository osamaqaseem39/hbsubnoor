# Political System Analysis: Mary, Queen of Scots (2018)

## A. Introduction
Mary, Queen of Scots (2018), directed by Josie Rourke, explores the intense rivalry and distant relationship between two formidable cousins: Mary Stuart of Scotland and Elizabeth I of England. The film chronicles Mary's return to Scotland in 1561 following the death of her French husband until her execution in 1587, depicting a dangerous political dance where coexistence is constantly threatened by competing claims to the English throne.
The mid-to-late 16th century setting is defined by intense religious conflict between Catholics and Protestants, shifting alliances, and profound political instability. The film captures the court as a center of scheming, where nobles, advisors, and religious leaders, such as John Knox, constantly plot. Key characters like Mary (Catholic queen in a Protestant land), Elizabeth (Protestant queen vigilant against Mary's claim), and advisors like William Cecil and James Stewart, Earl of Moray, navigate a landscape driven by ambition, faith, and survival.
## B. Political System Shown in the Film

The film illustrates the mechanics of absolute monarchy in 16th-century Scotland and England, where the queen’s power is theoretically derived from divine right. However, the film successfully contrasts this absolute theory with the practical fragility of the monarch’s power. The queen’s authority is shown to be contingent upon maintaining the support of the nobility and religious factions. The monarchy is deeply personal, meaning the queen's character, decisions, and private relationships directly dictate national policy, exemplified by Elizabeth's role as head of the Church of England versus Mary's systemic opposition as a Catholic ruler.
While a modern Parliamentary system did not exist, the film shows the function of proto-governmental structures. Both queens rely heavily on advisory councils (Elizabeth’s Privy Council and Mary’s Scottish Council) where decisions are discussed and influenced, though the queen retains final authority. Figures like William Cecil function as a proto-Prime Minister; he manages state affairs and policy but holds power solely based on the queen's personal trust, lacking any institutional stability or fixed term.
Formal political parties were absent, replaced by fluid noble and religious factions (Catholic vs. Protestant) vying for the monarch's favor, demonstrating how politics was driven by fluid loyalties and shared interests. Ultimately, the monarchy is the government, controlling executive decisions and foreign policy. Mary's deposition demonstrates the constant, practical negotiation required: failure to secure consensus from the nobles and religious leaders will invalidate even a divine claim to rule.
## C. Key Political Themes
The film foregrounds leadership in crisis and the unique challenges of gender and politics. Both queens operate under immense pressure, with personal decisions having vast national consequences; Mary’s impulsive marriage to Darnley, for instance, leads directly to the Rizzio murder and civil war. The patriarchal system, reinforced by preachers like Knox who denounced female rule, forces both women into difficult roles. Elizabeth responds by adopting a persona of masculine resolve and foregoing marriage, while Mary’s attempt to balance the roles of queen, wife, and mother is politically exploited.
Diplomacy and foreign policy between England and Scotland are depicted as intensely personal, driven entirely by the relationship between the two queens, their dynastic claims, and religious alignment. Official state policy, mediated by ambassadors and letters, often masks the real work of statecraft conducted through secret funding and back-channel plotting. This complex dynamic, characterized by a mix of mutual respect and existential threat, shows how the personal desires and rivalries of monarchs determined state policy.
## D. Accuracy and Historical Context
The film successfully captures the core historical realities: the severity of the religious conflict, John Knox's political writings, Mary's unstable reign, the 1565 Chaseabout Raid rebellion, the Rizzio murder, and Mary's legitimate claim to the English throne, which resulted in her son James eventually uniting the crowns in 1603.
However, the film takes certain dramaturgical liberties. The central secret meeting between Mary and Elizabeth, a powerful fictional device to explore their dynamic, never happened historically; their entire relationship was conducted through messengers. The movie also compresses the timeline of events and implies a certainty regarding Mary's involvement in Darnley's murder and her hasty marriage to Bothwell, aspects which remain historically debated and complex.
## E. Critical Analysis

The film offers a strong critique of absolute power by showing its practical fragility; the queen's authority required constant negotiation, fear management, and political maintenance from her council. The film adopts a noticeable feminist angle, portraying both queens sympathetically as intelligent figures trapped by a patriarchal system. While warm toward Mary's well-intentioned but impulsive nature, it provides a balanced, complex portrayal of all leaders, avoiding pure hero or villain archetypes.

Ultimately, the film demonstrates how political institutions, even in their early forms, shape every decision. The queens' reliance on nobles and military support shows that authority had to be constantly compromised. By illustrating the transition from a government entirely embodied by the monarch to a system with nascent councils, the film highlights the historical root of the modern UK political system, where democratic accountability and institutional checks gradually replaced the absolute power of the crown.

**Personal Learning**: This film provided valuable insights into how political systems operate in practice, particularly how personal relationships, religious authority, and dynastic claims can shape state policy in ways that abstract theories of government might not capture. The film illustrates how leadership in crisis requires not just good judgment but also the ability to manage competing interests, maintain loyalty, and make difficult choices with incomplete information. The portrayal of the relationship between Scotland and England shows how foreign policy can be driven by personal relationships between rulers, dynastic claims, and religious affiliations rather than purely national interests. Most importantly, the film demonstrates how political systems are not static structures but dynamic processes where authority must be constantly maintained, negotiated, and sometimes defended through force. The tragic outcome for Mary—despite her legitimate claim, her intelligence, and her initial popularity—shows how political systems can be unforgiving, where mistakes, bad luck, and the actions of others can lead to downfall regardless of personal qualities or good intentions.
